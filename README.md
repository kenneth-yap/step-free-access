# Improving Step Free Access of London Underground Stations

This notebook is produced as part of the Transport Systems module at Imperial College London, supervised by Dr Panagiotis Angeloudis. An important component of Transport for Londonâ€™s Accessibility Strategy has been to provide step-free access to as many London Underground stations as possible. As of late 2020, 80 Tube stations were step-free, with work underway in 12 more stations, which will bring the total number to 92 in the foreseeable future. The objective of the brief is to select the next batch of stations to be converted to step-free.
